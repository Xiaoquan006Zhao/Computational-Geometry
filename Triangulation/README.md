# Triangulation

Triangulation of a simple polygon. A solution to the Art Gallery problem. The approach taken is first decompose the simple
polygon into monotone pieces then decompose each monotone piece into triangles. 

* Simple polygon refers to polygon that does not have hole(s) and is not self-intersecting.
* Application of polygon triangulation can be seen a lot in the field of Computer Graphics. 
* Meshs are effictively stored as triangles. if you want some examples, please check out my 3D-Modeling repository.
